				<p>Need a creative rest period or a good nightâ€™s sleep? Are you too jet lagged to go on nonstop for the whole 48 hours? If yes, no worries, we got you covered!
				<br><br>
				Omena Hotels and Junction provide accommodation for all the Hackers coming out of town free of charge in downtown Helsinki. Teams of 4 people will have their own rooms and smaller or larger teams will share the room with other teams. Hackers receive their keys at the opening ceremony on Friday!
